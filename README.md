# What is Battlecode?
Battlecode is a real-time strategy game, for which you will write an AI player. In Battlecode, two teams of virtual robots roam the screen managing resources and executing different offensive strategies against each other. Our AI player strategically manage our robot army and controls how our robots work together to defeat the enemy team. We implement artificial intelligence, pathfinding, distributed algorithms, and network communications to make your player as competitive as possible.
